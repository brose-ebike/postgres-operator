# Azure

## Azure Flexible Server
The Azure flexible server is currently supported and tests are executed regularly.
More information can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/overview).

## Azure Single Server
The Azure Single Server is currently not supported, because the username structure will not work with this operator.
Since this type of PostgreSQL Database is already deprecated, it is unlikely that support will be implemented. 
More informations can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/single-server/concepts-version-policy#postgresql-11-support-in-single-server-and-flexible-server).
