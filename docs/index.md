# Postgres Controller

The postgres-controller adds roles (PgLoginRole is equal to users in Postgres) and databases (PgDatabase) as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of creating and managing databases and service roles.

It can manage a variety of supported Postgres versions from different Vendors (e.g. Self hosted, Azure, AWS, GCP).
