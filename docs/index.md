# Postgres Controller

The postgres-operator adds users (PgUser) and databases (PgDatabase) as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of creating and managing databases and service roles.

It can manage a variety of supported Postgres versions from different Vendors (e.g. Self hosted, Azure, AWS, GCP).

This website provides the full technical documentation for the project, and can be used as a reference;
